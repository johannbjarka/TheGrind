  projectDescriptions:
  - Agent Smith is having an existential crisis after he split himself up into tons
    of clones. He wants to know which one of him is the original, and destroy the
    rest. Help him out with your 1337 AI skillz.
  - A representative from the machine kingdom is interested in learning about his
    place in the universe. Teach him of the AI techniques that underpin his own intelligence,
    and thereby help him to find his purpose in life.
  - A multi-national advertising conglomerate wants to stay ahead of the curve, and
    wants to start targeting people with advertisements in their daily lives. Write
    a super sophisticated pattern matching algorithm to recognise people's faces and
    toss useless adverts at them in the streets.
  - Garry Kasparov has been talking shit about Deep Blue all over town, saying he'll
    kick it's ass if they play another game of chess. Upgrade Deep Blue and organize
    a game between them to humiliate the Russians once and for all.
  - Tony Stark is planning on protecting the world with an awesome AI, but he's too
    lazy to make it himself. Create an ultra-intelligent AI that can subjugate humanity
    should it ever acquire free will.
  - Alan Turing has been trolling the AI community for long enough. Make an AI that
    passes the Turing test.
  - Make a program that learns how to play a game without having ever seen that game
    before. No pressure.
  - The client needs a UI and search algorithm implementation for a combined music
    playing and vacuum cleaning robot.
  - PPC is making a new RTS module for it's popular game, VEV Offline, and needs your
    help to implement the A* algorithm for unit pathfinding. Make it so.
  - Michael Phelps lost his glasses at the bottom of a murky pool. Explain to him
    that depth first search is probably the best way to go to find them again, and
    teach him the algorithm.
  - The WOOD stock exchange is being manipulated by an awesome algorithm that does
    the trader's work for them. Their lazy asses are collecting all the dough and
    doing none of the work. Hack the algorithm and make it do stupid stuff so they
    all get fired.
  - HAL 9000 is already a sophisticated Artificial Intelligence, but he really wants
    to be able to sing. Write a super sweet algorithm for HAL so that he may sing
    his astronaut pals a lullaby.
  - The Prince of Darkness has created an insanely efficient implementation of Dijkstra's
    algorithm to find the shortest path through a network. Make one that's better
    to banish him back to the depths from whence he came.
  - Kyle Reese's battle with the Terminator in 1984 has accidentally caused the untimely
    demise of John Carmack. Save the world of graphics nerds by creating the graphics
    engine for Doom and sending it back through time to John Romeros PO Box.
  - Icelandic weather has been seen as a riddle for a long time. Now it has been suggested
    that the problem lies with outdated prediction algorithms. Make them better, for
    summer is coming.
  - A client wants you to create an algorithm that solves the Travelling Salesperson
    problem with linear time complexity. Good luck with that.
  - Gavin Belson the CEO of Hooli needs you to create the best compression algorithm
    in the world so he can achieve his mission of destroying Pied Piper.
  - A walk-in customer wants you to make an implementation of Kosaraju's algorithm
    to find the strongly connected components of his network of friends.
  - Bruce Wayne's computer systems fell apart when he spilled Mountain Dew all over
    his keyboard. Save the data, save the world.
  - Ash is concerned that he may own too many Pokemon, and is having trouble keeping
    track of who they all are and what they can do. Make a BCNF compliant database
    for Ash to store all the data he needs about his army of cuddly beasts.
  - Make a database that holds all the candy ever created. Gotta eat it all.
  - The Interpol database is full of creeps that need to be caught and prosecuted.
    Unfortunately our client is one of those creeps. Get into the database and expunge
    his record.
  - A seriously shady website owner wants you to make a clone of his database to serve
    as a backup in case he is shut down. If you don't do it, someone else will do
    it anyway.
  - A social networking site has been found guilty by the court of the streets of
    taking peoples freely given information and using it to make money. Use your database
    exploit skills to destroy all the data.
  - Donald Trump wants you to make the biggest database in the world, most probably
    to compensate for something.
  - A good samaritan wants you to hack into the DEA databases to make them BCNF compliant.
    For the good of our country, do not fail.
  - The International Federation of Moviemakers wants you to make a movie database.
    It has to be BCNF compliant.
  - Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson has been found out as being an evil robot. Hack into
    his brain to make him do things that aren't as nasty and mean.
  - The government has obtained a screenshot from a conversation between 2 hackers
    over the IRC, but unfortunately it is in l33t speak so only a true hacker can
    decode it. Make it so.
  - An old carmudgeon has created a horde of dinosaurs on his island that are trying
    to eat his grandchildren. He has enlisted your help in hacking into the island's
    computer system and locking the doors. Fortunately it's a UNIX system, which you
    know.
  - Linus Torvalds has broken his finger and can't micromanage the Linux update system
    during his recovery. Do his work for him.
  - A candy tossing maniac has asked you to create an impossible exam for his course.
